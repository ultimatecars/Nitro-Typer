# NitroTyper - The Ultimate Nitrotype Console Bot

**NitroTyper** is an advanced, **undetectable** console bot designed to automate racing in **Nitrotype**, the popular online typing game. With NitroTyper, you can complete up to **1,300 races per day** at any typing speed between **10 WPM - 180 WPM**. When paired with a **Capsolver** (like 2Captcha), NitroTyper can easily handle the full 1,300 races a day, while without a Capsolver, you can still achieve **600-800 races a day**. This bot is specifically built to **remain undetected by Nitrotype** and is **unflaggable on NTComps**.

## Features

- **Undetectable**: NitroTyper is designed to simulate human-like behavior, making it **undetectable by Nitrotype**'s anti-cheat systems. You can race for hours without worrying about being flagged or banned.
  
- **Flawless NTComps Integration**: The bot runs smoothly in **NTComps**, ensuring that your races are **unflaggable**. Compete in Nitrotype competitions without the risk of being flagged.

- **Customizable Typing Speeds**: Set your desired typing speed anywhere between **10 WPM** (slow) and **180 WPM** (fast). Tailor the bot’s speed to your comfort level or desired race completion time.

- **CAPTCHA Solving Support (Capsolver Required)**: With a **Capsolver** (e.g., 2Captcha, Anti-Captcha), the bot can complete up to **1,300 races** per day. Without a Capsolver, you can still complete **600-800 races daily**.

- **Fully Automated**: Set it and forget it! NitroTyper runs automatically, completing races, accumulating rewards, and improving your Nitrotype account while you do other things.
